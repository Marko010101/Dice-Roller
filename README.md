# Welcome to My Dice-Roller Game!

## What's This Game About?

**My Dice-Roller** is a fun game where you'll compete against an automated opponent called as `autoPlayer`. Your main aim is to reach 100 points before `autoPlayer` does, but there's a twist - you'll need to make some smart choices when rolling the dice.

## How to Play

1. To start, just click the "Roll Dice" button and let the game begin.
2. If you roll anything except a 1, you can decide whether to keep those points or keep rolling to gather more. Just click "Hold" to save your points and end your turn.
3. If you roll a 1 or choose "Hold," it'll be `autoPlayer`'s turn to give it a shot.

## Winning the Game

The game keeps going until one of you hits 100 points. When that happens, a pop-up will announce whether you're the winner or not.

## The Tech I Used

I've used some tech to create this game:

- **HTML**: This is the foundation of the game's appearance.
- **CSS**: It's responsible for making the game look appealing and stylish.
- **JavaScript**: This is where I've defined all the game's rules and made everything work, just as you see on the screen.

## Let's Have Fun!
